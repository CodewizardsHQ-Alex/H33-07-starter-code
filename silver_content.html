    <h3>The Tree of Silver Wings</h3>
    
    <p>The Tree of Silver Wings is a mysterious entity referred to by multiple sources, typically in association with either the Black Garden or the metaphorical "garden" allegorically used to describe the state of reality predating the universe.</p>
    
    <p>The tree once existed alongside the Gardener and Winnower. It was described as "ruinous", "disastrous", the air around it inspiring violence in those who would breathe even a little in. It was later brought down by the two entities fighting with each other, and left to smoke amid the meadows.</p>
