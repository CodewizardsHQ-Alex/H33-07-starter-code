    <h3>Pine</h3>
    
    <p>A pine is any conifer in the genus Pinus of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae. The Plant List compiled by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Missouri Botanical Garden accepts 126 species names of pines as current, together with 35 unresolved species and many more synonyms.</p>
    
    <p>Pine may also refer to the lumber derived from pine trees; pine is one of the more extensively used types of wood used as lumber. The modern English name "pine" derives from Latin pinus, which some have traced to the Indo-European base *pīt- ‘resin’ (source of English pituitary).</p>
